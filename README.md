# protocol-droid

***Project not functional!***

Provides a context menu on links with web protocols for selecting protocol
handlers (even if a default one has already been set).

Also provides an optional context menu on all links (excluding those ending
in "html" or "htm") which when entered will detect content-type of the
remote resource (via an HTTP HEAD Request) and display the
available content type handlers (even if a default one has already been set).
